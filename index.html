			<h1>Parkinson’s disease</h1>
			<p><b>Coffee</b> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted <b>coffee beans</b>, the seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the <b>Coffea genus</b>. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. When people think of coffee, they usually think of its ability to provide an energy boost. However, according to some research, it can also offer some other important health benefits. Such benefits may include a lower risk of liver cancer, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure.

The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.</p>

				<h1>Coffee and Parkinson’s disease</h1>
Various studies have suggested that caffeine, which is present in coffee and many other beverages, may help protect against Parkinson’s disease.

One team concluded that men who drink over four cups of coffee per day might have a fivefold lower risk of Parkinson’s disease than those who do not.
